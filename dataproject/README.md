# Data Project - The Taylor Rule

In this project we will examine the Taylor Rule for US data.

We import data for the funds rate, the price index, the gdp and the potential gdp from the US. All of the data is downloaded from FRED using FRED's API. We will use these variables to see if the FED sets the funds rate according to the Taylor Rule.

We select a time period to investigate and plausible parameters in the Taylor rule with interactive sliders connected to a plot.

We estimate the parameters in the Taylor rule using three different ways to calculate the OLS estimator.

Finally, we preform some robustness checks to our model.
