# Income taxation and the behaviour of a worker.

In this project, we examine the change of behaviour of a worker due to a change in the margina tax rate. Firs, we analytically examine the optimal behaviour of a worker in a proportional tax system using the `sympy` package. We then examine the same problem grahpically. Finally, we simulate a population of agents with different income potentials and different elasticities using `numpy.random` and estiamte the tax rate which maximizes the tax revenue using `numpy.optimize`.

After examine these problems in a proportional tax system we repeat the analysis for a tax system which allows for different tax rate on  each side of a kink, i.e. a tax system which can be proportional, regressive or progressive.
